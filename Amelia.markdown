You are a mouse. Your life has always been one of caution and fear. scurrying from house to house in search of crumbs. dodging the hungry gaze of preds and the stomping paws of giants. It's a rough life but it is your's, was your's you guess. You found yourself today having made a mistake that cost you your freedom. A simple pantry raid without checking what kind of giant owned the place. Now you find yourself staring at smiling face of a female cheetah.

"Well hello their my little mouse." she coos, her voice surpisingly soft and silklike for something that could execute you with a single bite. 

"You look pretty smart, so i assume you realize you won't be able to outrun me, but that is okay, I don't plan on eating you..." Can this be you think, the feline doesn't want you devour you, you just hit the jackpot! 

"No no, I want you to feed yourself to me like a good mouse... willingly, as an ingrediant." Your heart sinks, willingly? Ingrediant? is this cat mad? 

"till then you get to know the body you will be adding to eventually" without warning the chee snatches you up in her paw, leathery pads wrapping around your body as she removes you from her cupboard like any other food item.

Wiggling in her grasp you try to break free as she brings you to her bed and places you at the height of the belly. The large tan expanse stretches out before you, a taunt tummy designed to turn you from mouse to meal. 

"Do you like what you see little one? You will soon be part of all this pretty." the cheetah rubs her belly as it gives a small growl of hunger, a growl that becons for you do join it.

...

You climb into the bowl as the cheetah grabs her favorite ice cream from the freezer. Soon you find yourself shivering as the cat scoops in a the frozen treat. You wonder if you really want this. But as she licks her lips you remember that you do, you want to join the pretty that is her.

You find yourself laid between 2 large scoops of hazelnut ice cream that matches your fur and drizzles of chocolate added to you as it stripping your very fur. Your tiny ears pick up a low gutteral groan, the cheetah's stomach calling out to you, it's probably pictured this moment from the second those golden eyes first settled upon you. Now you lay between those mounds of frozen dairy a freezing scrumptious treat.

"Are you cold dreary? Let me help" she brings her muzzle down to all you can see is her tan muzzle and black lips before they part. Hot wafting breath and dripping drool strands greet you. You do feel warmer and you even notice that you are not the only thing melting as your limbs sink into the warming domes.
