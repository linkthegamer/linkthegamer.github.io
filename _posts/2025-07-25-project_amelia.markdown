You are a mouse. Your life has always been one of caution and fear. scurrying from house to house in search of crumbs. dodging the hungry gaze of preds and the stomping paws of giants. It's a rough life but it is your's, was your's you guess. You found yourself today having made a mistake that cost you your freedom. A simple pantry raid without checking what kind of giant owned the place. Now you find yourself staring at smiling face of a female cheetah.

"Well hello their my little mouse."

she coos, her voice surpisingly soft and silklike for something that could execute you with a single bite. 

"You look pretty smart, so i assume you realize you won't be able to outrun me, but that is okay, I don't plan on eating you..."

Can this be you think, the feline doesn't want you devour you, you just hit the jackpot! 

"No no, I want you to feed yourself to me like a good mouse... willingly, as an ingrediant."

Your heart sinks, willingly? Ingrediant? is this cat mad? 

"till then you get to know the body you will be adding to eventually"

without warning the chee snatches you up in her paw, leathery pads wrapping around your body as she removes you from her cupboard like any other food item.

Wiggling in her grasp you try to break free as she brings you to her bed and places you at the height of the belly. The large tan expanse stretches out before you, a taunt tummy designed to turn you from mouse to meal. 

"Do you like what you see little one? You will soon be part of all this pretty."

the cheetah rubs her belly as it gives a small growl of hunger, a growl that becons for you do join it. You look behind you and see a drop you can't hope to survive without injury, you look in front of you and see that stomach

"Don't be afriad to touch it, it is going to be your new home eventually"

You shiver at the thought, this belly will end you, and according to the cheetah you will be the one who ask it to. Suddently a paw gives you a small push toward the stomach. You are still nervious she will decide to eat you if you don't comply so you tenetatively place a paw on the taunt stomach, the fur under your paw bristling and shuddering, another deep glork echoing out from just beyond all that fur, muscle, and fat.

The belly of the cheetah is flat yet you can tell it has handled many of your kind already. And yet... it is so soft to the touch. If it wasn't attached to a machine that turned people your size into more spots you could see yourself resting upon it. In fact without thinking you do rest you tired head against it as your ear and muzzle go flush against it. A purring drone along with the heartbeat and warmth welcome you. In your relaxed state you must admit this feline does have a lovely quality to her, if she was your size you would probably ask her to dinner... Dinner, you are reminded that she wants you to be her dinner, or maybe lunch. You don't really know when she expects you to give yourself to her, but you know that she does expect that you will be the one to do it.

Before you know it the beating of her heart and even those unsettling internal stomach nosies have lulled you to sleep. The cheetah seems to have move you to a table as your now laying on a wwooden expanse as you stir.

"It's dinner time cutie"

You awwaken with a start at those word as you stare at her... the lying feline she is going to eat you after all, you knew it you...


"Don't look so scared, you are going to watch me eat my meal... then hopefully you'll serve yourself up as my dessert."


...

You climb into the bowl as the cheetah grabs her favorite ice cream from the freezer. Soon you find yourself shivering as the cat scoops in a the frozen treat. You wonder if you really want this. But as she licks her lips you remember that you do, you want to join the pretty that is her.

Soon, you find yourself laid between 2 large scoops of hazelnut ice cream that matches your fur and drizzles of chocolate added to you as if stripping your very fur. Your tiny ears pick up a low gutteral groan, the cheetah's stomach calling out to you, it's probably pictured this moment from the second those golden eyes first settled upon you. Now you lay between those mounds of frozen dairy a freezing scrumptious treat.

"Are you cold dear? Let me help" 

she brings her muzzle down to all you can see is her tan snout and black lips before they part. Hot wafting breath and dripping drool strands greet you. You do feel warmer and you even notice that you are not the only thing melting as your limbs sink into the warming domes. With a loud teasing snap she closes her mouth back up, teeth clacking like ivory gates.

"Don't want you and the ice cream to melt into a soup on me now... well not till your both inside of me."

she chides as she sits back and grabs the spoon, digging it into one of the scoops. You watch as she moves the spoon to her opening mouth. You watch as she slowly inserts that creamy treat into her muzzle and closes her lips around the spoon before pulling it out empty. she would savor the mouthful for a moment before swallowing it down, a lump forming in her throat before disappearing behind her collar. Just like you will soon enough.
